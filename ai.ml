(*[health_check state] is the function for the ai to choose what move to
  do next. Based on the health of the ai, there are different
  probabilities for the different moves. If the AIâ€™s health is less than
  or equal to 40% of their total health (which is their level * 10 +
  10), they have a 25% chance of attacking the player, a 37.5% chance of
  healing and 37.5% chance of defense. If their health is above 40%, it
  has a 75% chance of attacking, a 12.5% chance of healing, and a 12.5%
  chance of defense. The Random.float bound was used to determine which
  move is done. Floats from 0-10 are partitioned to reflect the
  percentages (e.g, to attack the player when the AI has less than 40%
  health, Random.float 10 would need to return a number less than 2.5).
  Requires [state] be a valid State.t*)
